# Amazon_Review_Sentimental_Analysis

This project is in collaboration with Xinyu Hu, Zhe Wang, Yumeng Zou, Shijun Wei and Zhenghao Zhou.

In this project we used three NLP methods: bag of words, n-gram, and TF-IDF to conduct sentiment analysis on Amazon reviews. We also looked into specific low-rated items to see what lead to bad reviews.

Based on the results, we recommend reassess the pricing strategy and conduct some market research to see if lower prices are needed. We also recommend surveying customers to study what are their preferred flavors and presentation. Lastly, we recommend exploring more on the highest rated products and see if there are any popular products that can be potentially added to the store and increase product variety.
